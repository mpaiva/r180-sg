# R180 - HTML Style Guide

This is a preview style guide that will serve as HTML boilerplate for a client's website.

The objective of publishing these files is to assist front-end developers with a set of themed bootstrap files as starting point.

## Requirements

1. Bootstrap 
2. LESS
3. Apache Server - PHP

## Getting Started 
1. Clone this repository
2. Install folder on your local apache server and load your localhost.

## Feedback is welcomed
Please add any feedback on the [Issues Page](https://github.com/mpaiva/r180-sg/issues).

## Roadmap
1. Create a straight HTML version (Jade Templates), removing any PHP function to allow running it locally without the need of a server.

## Release Notes
